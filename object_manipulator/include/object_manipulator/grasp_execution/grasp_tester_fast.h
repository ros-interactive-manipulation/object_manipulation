//! Uses an interpolated IK approach from pregrasp to final grasp
/*! Initial check consists of IK for the pre-grasp, followed by generation
  of an interpolated IK path from pre-grasp to grasp. This is then followed
  by computation of an interpolated IK path from grasp to lift.

  Execution consists of using move arm to go to the pre-grasp, then execution of 
  the interpolated IK paths for grasp. Lift is executed separately, called from
  the higher level executor.

  Note that we do not use the pre-grasp from the database directly; rather, the
  pre-grasp is obtained by backing up the grasp by a pre-defined amount. This
  allows us more flexibility in choosing the pre-grasp. However, we can no longer
  always assume the pre-grasp is collision free, which we could if we used the 
  pre-grasp from the database directly.

  In the most recent database version, the pre-grasp was obtained by backing up 
  10 cm, so we know at least that that is not colliding with the object.
